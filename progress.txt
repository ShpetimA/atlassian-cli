## 2026-01-19 - Phase 1 Complete (Core + Config)

Implemented jira-cli foundation in jira-cli/ directory:

Files created:
- jira-cli/package.json - CLI package with `jc` binary
- jira-cli/tsconfig.json - TypeScript config (ES2022, NodeNext)
- jira-cli/src/index.ts - CLI entry point with global options
- jira-cli/src/config.ts - Config file + env var resolution
- jira-cli/src/clients/jira.ts - JiraClient with basic auth
- jira-cli/src/types/jira.ts - TypeScript interfaces
- jira-cli/src/utils/output.ts - JSON/plain/minimal formatters
- jira-cli/src/commands/issue.ts - Full issue CRUD + comments
- jira-cli/src/commands/config.ts - Config management
- jira-cli/src/commands/search.ts - JQL search

Commands implemented:
- jc issue list/get/create/edit/delete
- jc issue assign/transitions/transition
- jc issue comments/comment
- jc search <jql>
- jc config init/set/get/list/profile

Auth: env vars (JIRA_DOMAIN, JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_API_TOKEN) or config file

Note for next person: Phase 2 (Issue CRUD + ADF) partially done since create/edit/delete/assign already implemented. Focus on marklassian integration for proper ADF conversion.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 3 Complete (Agile - Boards & Sprints)

Implemented full agile support in jira-cli:

Files created:
- jira-cli/src/types/agile.ts - Board, Sprint, BoardConfiguration types
- jira-cli/src/clients/jira-agile.ts - JiraAgileClient for /rest/agile/1.0 API
- jira-cli/src/commands/board.ts - Board commands
- jira-cli/src/commands/sprint.ts - Sprint commands

Commands implemented:
- jc board list/get/config/issues/backlog
- jc sprint list/get/issues/create/start/close/move-issues/to-backlog

API coverage:
- Boards: list, get, configuration, issues, backlog
- Sprints: list, get, issues, create, update (start/close), move issues

Note for next person: Phase 4 (Epics & Backlog) is next. Also Phase 2 still needs marklassian for ADF conversion - lower priority since raw ADF works.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 4 Complete (Epics & Backlog Ranking)

Added epic management to jira-cli:

Files modified/created:
- jira-cli/src/types/agile.ts - Added Epic, EpicsResponse, MoveIssuesToEpicRequest, RankIssuesRequest types
- jira-cli/src/clients/jira-agile.ts - Added listEpics, getEpic, getEpicIssues, moveIssuesToEpic, removeIssuesFromEpic, rankIssues methods
- jira-cli/src/commands/epic.ts - New file with epic commands
- jira-cli/src/index.ts - Registered epic command

Commands implemented:
- jc epic list <board-id> [--done|--not-done]
- jc epic get <key>
- jc epic issues <key> [-j jql] [--fields]
- jc epic move-issues <key> --issues PROJ-1,PROJ-2
- jc epic remove-issues --issues PROJ-1,PROJ-2
- jc epic rank --issues PROJ-1 --before|--after PROJ-2

API coverage:
- GET /board/{id}/epic - list board epics
- GET /epic/{key} - get epic details
- GET /epic/{key}/issue - get epic issues
- POST /epic/{key}/issue - move issues to epic
- POST /epic/none/issue - remove from epic
- PUT /issue/rank - reorder backlog

Note for next person: Phase 5 (search count, async task polling, archive) or Phase 6 (Confluence) next. marklassian still deferred. Velocity/burndown reports deferred to P2.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 5 Partial (Search Count)

Added `jc search count` command for approximate issue counts.

Files modified:
- jira-cli/src/types/jira.ts - Added ApproximateCountResponse type
- jira-cli/src/clients/jira.ts - Added getApproximateCount method (POST /search/approximate-count)
- jira-cli/src/commands/search.ts - Added `count` subcommand, restructured to support both `jc search <jql>` and `jc search count <jql>`

Usage:
- jc search count "project = PROJ" → { "count": 42 }
- jc search "project = PROJ" → still works (backwards compatible)
- jc search query "project = PROJ" → explicit query subcommand

Note for next person: Phase 5 still needs async task polling + jc issue archive. Then Phase 6 Confluence. Consider whether async polling is worth it vs jumping to Confluence which has more user value.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 6 Complete (Confluence)

Implemented Confluence REST API v2 support in jira-cli.

Files created:
- jira-cli/src/types/confluence.ts - Space, Page, FooterComment, Label types
- jira-cli/src/clients/confluence.ts - ConfluenceClient for /wiki/api/v2
- jira-cli/src/commands/space.ts - Space commands
- jira-cli/src/commands/page.ts - Page commands (CRUD + comments + labels)

Files modified:
- jira-cli/src/index.ts - Registered space and page commands

Commands implemented:
- jc space list [--type global|personal] [--status current|archived]
- jc space get <id-or-key>
- jc page list --space <id> [--status] [--sort]
- jc page get <id> [--body storage|atlas_doc_format|view]
- jc page create --space <id> --title <title> [--parent <id>] [--body <html>] [--body-file <path>]
- jc page update <id> --title <title> [--body <html>] [--body-file <path>] [--message <msg>]
- jc page delete <id>
- jc page children <id>
- jc page comments <id>
- jc page comment <id> <text>
- jc page labels <id>
- jc page add-label <id> <label>

API coverage:
- GET /spaces - list spaces
- GET /spaces/{id} - get space
- GET /pages - list pages
- GET /pages/{id} - get page
- POST /pages - create page
- PUT /pages/{id} - update page
- DELETE /pages/{id} - delete page
- GET /pages/{id}/children - child pages
- GET /pages/{id}/footer-comments - list comments
- POST /footer-comments - add comment
- GET /pages/{id}/labels - list labels
- POST /pages/{id}/labels - add label

Note for next person: Phase 7 (Polish) is next: projects, links, labels, filters, worklogs, attachments, watchers. Phase 5 async task polling still outstanding but low priority.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 7 Partial (Projects)

Implemented `jc project` commands for project management.

Files modified/created:
- jira-cli/src/types/jira.ts - Added ProjectFull, ProjectSearchResult, ProjectStatus, ProjectComponent, ProjectVersion types
- jira-cli/src/clients/jira.ts - Added listProjects, getProject, getProjectStatuses, getProjectComponents, getProjectVersions methods
- jira-cli/src/commands/project.ts - New file with project commands
- jira-cli/src/index.ts - Registered project command

Commands implemented:

- GET /project/{key} - get project details
- GET /project/{key}/statuses - list statuses by issue type
- GET /project/{key}/components - list components
- GET /project/{key}/version - list versions with pagination

Note for next person: Phase 7 continues with links, labels, fields, filters. Consider issue links (POST /issueLink, GET /issueLinkType) as next priority - useful for dependency tracking. Async task polling (Phase 5) remains low priority.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 7 Partial (Issue Links)

Implemented `jc issue link/links/link-types/unlink` commands for issue dependency tracking.

Files modified:
- jira-cli/src/types/jira.ts - Added IssueLinkType, IssueLinkTypesResponse, LinkedIssue, IssueLink, CreateIssueLinkRequest types

- jc issue unlink <linkId> - Delete a link by ID

API coverage:
- GET /issueLinkType - list link types
- POST /issueLink - create link
- DELETE /issueLink/{id} - delete link
- GET /issue/{key} with issuelinks field - get issue links

Note for next person: Phase 7 continues with labels (`jc labels`, `jc fields`, `jc issue add-label`) and filters. Could also do worklogs/attachments but those are P2. Async task polling (Phase 5) still low priority.

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 7 Partial (Labels & Fields)

Implemented `jc label` and `jc field` commands plus issue label management.

Files created:
- jira-cli/src/commands/label.ts - Label list command
- jira-cli/src/commands/field.ts - Field list command with filters

Files modified:
- jira-cli/src/types/jira.ts - Added Label, LabelsResponse, JiraField types
- jira-cli/src/clients/jira.ts - Added listLabels, listFields methods
- jira-cli/src/commands/issue.ts - Added add-label, remove-label subcommands

Files created:
- jira-cli/src/commands/filter.ts - Filter commands (list, get, create, update, delete)

- jc filter get <id> [--expand sharedUsers,subscriptions]
- jc filter create --name <name> --jql <jql> [--description] [--favourite]
- jc filter update <id> [--name] [--jql] [--description] [--favourite|--no-favourite]
